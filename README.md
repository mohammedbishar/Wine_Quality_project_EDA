# Wine_Quality_project_EDA
# 1) problem statement

  1. Goal of the Data

      he main objective of this dataset is to analyze and predict wine quality based on various physicochemical properties, such as acidity, sugar levels, sulfur dioxide, pH, and alcohol content.

  2. Description of Dataset

       The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
  3. About the Data
  
  The dataset you provided, Wine Quality, typically contains physicochemical properties of different wine samples along with their quality ratings
